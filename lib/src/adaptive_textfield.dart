  /// composed characters), so this will be inaccurate in the presence of those
  /// characters. If you expect to encounter these kinds of characters, be
  /// generous in the maxLength used.
  ///
  /// For instance, the character "ö" can be represented as '\u{006F}\u{0308}',
  /// which is the letter "o" followed by a composed diaeresis "¨", or it can
  /// be represented as '\u{00F6}', which is the Unicode scalar value "LATIN
  /// SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS". In the first case, the text field will
  /// count two characters, and the second case will be counted as one
  /// character, even though the user can see no difference in the input.
  ///
  /// Similarly, some emoji are represented by multiple scalar values. The
  /// Unicode "THUMBS UP SIGN + MEDIUM SKIN TONE MODIFIER", "👍🏽", should be
  /// counted as a single character, but because it is a combination of two
  /// Unicode scalar values, '\u{1F44D}\u{1F3FD}', it is counted as two
  /// characters.
